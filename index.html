 <h1>Experience</h1>
<p>  I have leadership background from high school.Okay I will have to tell a story when I ti prefectship my class was probably the most disorganised class.It was not clean andthere was a sense of unity what the class was missing a leader with radical idea ibelieved we vhad to just be the cleanest class and so I started my campaign and it seemed that l was alone and the all class came behind me and we went ahead to have the best year that year.However the sad part of the story is that neccesity as a class prefect ended and so I ecame an hindrance toward the end. </p>
